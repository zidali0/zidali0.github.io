			<p>My name is Zida Li. I’m a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at University of Michigan. I’m expected to graduate in the summer of 2018. </p>
			<p>In my research, I develop miniaturized devices/platforms for biomedical application using micro/nanotechnology. In particular, I’m interested in blood clotting testing, cancer metastasis modeling, and drug teratogenicity testing.</p>
			<p>My career goal is to translate my expertise in mechanical and biomedical engineering into products, and make healthcare services less costly and more accessible. </p>
			<p>Outside of academia, I like sports and music. I play basketball and guitar. I also like different cultures. I live in a student co-op with more than 150 housemates from different parts of the world.</p>

				<p class="news_content"><a href="http://www.baxter.com/inside-baxter/science/programs/young-investigator-award.page" taget="_blank">Baxter's Young Investigator Award</a>, which is sponsored by Baxter International Inc., is “intended to stimulate and reward research applicable to the development of therapies and medical products that save and sustain patients' lives.” In 2016, six researchers were awarded with the first-tier award. I was privileged to receive this award and gave a presentation on my research at the awards ceremony at Baxter R&D Center in Illinois.</p>

				<p class="news_title"><b>06/28/2016</b>: I attended Gordon Research Conference on Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices. </p>

				<p class="news_title"><b>06/01/2016</b>: I presented the work on coagulation device in ISMM 2016 at the University of Hong Kong!</p>
				<p class="news_content">ISMM is an annual meeting on micro- and nano- technologies. This year it was hosted by the University of Hong Kong where I used to work from 2012 to 2013. I was granted an oral talk on the development of coagulation testing device. It was also great to meet my former colleagues at HKU in a professional occasion. </p>

				<p class="news_title"><b>05/24/2016</b>: Manuscript on coagulation device has been accepted by Small.</p>
				<p class="news_content">This project was started in the fall of 2013. The device design evolved through three major versions. Publishable data was fully collected in the summer of 2015 and manuscript was finalized in September 2015. Patent was filed in March 2016. Manuscript was submitted in the same month and accepted in May. It was selected as the frontispiece of that issue of August 2016 of Small Journal.</p>

				<p class="news_title"><b>11/11/2013</b>: Manuscript on interfacial fluctuation of aqueous two-phase system was accepted by Lab On a Chip! </p>
				<p class="news_content">This paper was the first one I published. I joined Dr. Anderson Shum’s lab in Aug. 2012 and started working on this project. A major breakthrough happened in November 2012. Manuscript was first submitted in May 2013. </br>
				This paper talks about how a special interface can demonstrate the minute fluctuation in the flow in a microfluidic channel. This interface forms between two immiscible aqueous solutions with ultralow interfacial tension. Due to this property, the interface is very sensitive to the fluctuation in the flow and ripples are generated on it as a result. The frequency and amplitude of these ripples helps characterize the flow fluctuation.</br>
				This property was further studied and utilized to recover information from sound wave. For example, by introducing sound wave into the microfluidic channel, the flow fluctuates and the interface reacts in such a way that by processing the ripples generated, we can recover the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the sound wave. A paper first-authored by my colleague Sze Yi Mak was published on Scientific Reports in Sep. 2014. Recovering music was demonstrated.
